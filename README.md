**TitanicDataExploration**
This repository is dedicated to exploring and visualizing the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, cabin class, fare, and survival status.

**About the Dataset**

The Titanic dataset is widely used in data science and machine learning to develop predictive models and gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. It consists of the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
